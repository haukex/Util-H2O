=head1 Description

This module allows you to turn hashrefs into objects, so that instead
of C<< $hash->{key} >> you can write C<< $hash->key >>, plus you get
protection from typos. In addition, options are provided that allow
you to whip up really simple classes.

You can still use the hash like a normal hashref as well, as in
C<< $hash->{key} >>, C<keys %$hash>, and so on, but note that by
default this function also locks the hash's keyset to prevent typos
there too.

This module exports a single function by default.

=head2 C<h2o I<@opts>, I<$hashref>, I<@additional_keys>>

=head3 C<@opts>

If you specify an option with a value multiple times, only the last
one will take effect.

=over

=item C<-recurse>

Nested hashes are objectified as well.
The only option that is passed down to nested hashes is C<-lock>.
I<None> of the other options will be applied to the nested hashes, including
C<@additional_keys>. Nested arrayrefs are not recursed into.

Versions of this module before v0.12 did not pass down the C<-lock> option,
meaning that if you used C<-nolock, -recurse> on those versions, the nested
hashes would still be locked.

=item C<-meth>

Any code references present in the hash at the time of this function
call will be turned into methods. Because these methods are installed
into the object's package, they can't be changed later by modifying
the hash.

To avoid confusion when iterating over the hash, the hash entries
that were turned into methods are removed from the hash. The key is
also removed from the "allowed keys" (see the C<-lock> option),
I<unless> you specify it in C<@additional_keys>. In that case, you
can change the value of that key completely independently of the
method with the same name.

=item C<< -class => I<classname> >>

Specify the class name into which to bless the object (as opposed to
the default: a generated, unique package name in C<Util::H2O::>).

I<Note:> If you use this option, C<-clean> defaults to I<false>,
meaning that the package will stay in Perl's symbol table and use
memory accordingly, and since this function installs the accessors in
the package every time it is called, if you re-use the same package
name, you will get "redefined" warnings. Therefore, if you want to
create multiple objects in the same package, you should probably use
C<-new>.

=item C<< -classify => I<classname> >>

Short form of the options C<< -new, -meth, -class => I<classname> >>.

=item C<-new>

Generates a constructor named C<new> in the package. The constructor
works as a class and instance method, and dies if it is given any
arguments that it doesn't know about. If you want more advanced
features, like required arguments, validation, or other
initialization, you should probably switch to something like L<Moo>
instead.

=item C<< -clean => I<bool> >>

Whether or not to clean up the generated package when the object is
destroyed. Defaults to I<false> when C<-class> is specified, I<true>
otherwise. If this is I<false>, be aware that the packages will stay
in Perl's symbol table and use memory accordingly.

=item C<< -lock => I<bool> >>

Whether or not to use L<Hash::Util>'s C<lock_ref_keys> to prevent
modifications to the hash's keyset. Defaults to I<true>.
The C<-nolock> option is provided as a short form of C<< lock=>0 >>.

Keysets of objects created by the constructor generated by the
C<-new> option are also locked. Versions of this module before
v0.12 did not lock the keysets of new objects.

Note that on really old Perls, that is, before Perl v5.8.9,
L<Hash::Util> and its C<lock_ref_keys> are not available, so the hash
is never locked on those versions of Perl. Versions of this module
before v0.06 did not lock the keyset.

=item C<-nolock>

Short form of the option C<< lock=>0 >>.

=back

=head3 C<$hashref>

You must supply a plain (unblessed) hash reference here. Be aware
that this function I<does> modify the original hashref(s) by blessing
it and locking its keyset (the latter can be disabled with the
C<-lock> option).

An accessor will be set up for each key in the hash; note that the
keys must of course be valid Perl identifiers for you to be able to
call the method normally.

When C<-clean> is I<true> (the default, unless you use C<-class>),
the hash may not contain a key named C<DESTROY>. When C<-new> is
used, the hash may not contain a key named C<new>.

=head3 C<@additional_keys>

Methods will be set up for these keys even if they do not exist in the hash.

=head3 Returns

The (now blessed and optionally locked) C<$hashref>.

=head1 Notes

=head2 C<AUTOLOAD>

If your hash contains a key named C<AUTOLOAD>, or this key is present in
C<@additional_keys>, this module will set up a method called C<AUTOLOAD>, which
is subject to Perl's normal autoloading behavior - see L<perlsub/Autoloading>
and L<perlobj/AUTOLOAD>. Without the C<-meth> option (which is implied by
C<-classify>), you will get a "catch-all" accessor to which all method calls to
unknown method names will go, and with C<-meth> enabled, you can install your
own custom C<AUTOLOAD> handler by passing a coderef as the value for this key.
However, it is important to note that enabling autoloading removes any typo
protection on method names.

=head1 See Also

Inspired in part by C<lock_keys> from L<Hash::Util>.

Many, many other modules exist to simplify object creation in Perl.
This one is mine C<;-P>

Similar modules include L<Object::Adhoc|Object::Adhoc>,
L<Object::Anon|Object::Anon>, L<Hash::AsObject|Hash::AsObject>,
L<Object::Result|Object::Result>, and L<Hash::Wrap|Hash::Wrap>,
the latter of which also contains a comprehensive list of similar
modules.

For real OO work, I like L<Moo> and L<Type::Tiny>.
