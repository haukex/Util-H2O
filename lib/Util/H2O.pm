=head1 Description

This module allows you to turn hashrefs into objects, so that instead
of C<< $hash->{key} >> you can write C<< $hash->key >>, plus you get
protection from typos. In addition, options are provided that allow
you to whip up really simple classes.

You can still use the hash like a normal hashref as well, as in
C<< $hash->{key} >>, C<keys %$hash>, and so on, but note that by
default this function also locks the hash's keyset to prevent typos
there too.

This module exports a single function by default.

=head2 C<h2o I<@opts>, I<$hashref>, I<@additional_keys>>

=head3 C<@opts>

If you specify an option with a value multiple times, only the last
one will take effect.

=over

=item C<-recurse>

Nested hashes are objectified as well. The only options that are passed down to
nested hashes are C<-lock> and C<-ro>. I<None> of the other options will be
applied to the nested hashes, including C<@additional_keys>. Nested arrayrefs
are not recursed into.

Versions of this module before v0.12 did not pass down the C<-lock> option,
meaning that if you used C<-nolock, -recurse> on those versions, the nested
hashes would still be locked.

=item C<-meth>

Any code references present in the hash at the time of this function
call will be turned into methods. Because these methods are installed
into the object's package, they can't be changed later by modifying
the hash.

To avoid confusion when iterating over the hash, the hash entries
that were turned into methods are removed from the hash. The key is
also removed from the "allowed keys" (see the C<-lock> option),
I<unless> you specify it in C<@additional_keys>. In that case, you
can change the value of that key completely independently of the
method with the same name.

=item C<< -class => I<classname> >>

Specify the class name into which to bless the object (as opposed to
the default: a generated, unique package name in C<Util::H2O::>).

I<Note:> If you use this option, C<-clean> defaults to I<false>,
meaning that the package will stay in Perl's symbol table and use
memory accordingly, and since this function installs the accessors in
the package every time it is called, if you re-use the same package
name, you will get "redefined" warnings. Therefore, if you want to
create multiple objects in the same package, you should probably use
C<-new>.

=item C<< -classify => I<classname> >>

Short form of the options C<< -new, -meth, -class => I<classname> >>.

=item C<< -isa => I<arrayref or scalar> >>

Convenience option to set the L<C<@ISA>|perlvar/"@ISA"> variable in the package
of the object, so that the object inherits from that/those package(s).
This option was added in v0.14.

=item C<-new>

Generates a constructor named C<new> in the package. The constructor
works as a class and instance method, and dies if it is given any
arguments that it doesn't know about. If you want more advanced
features, like required arguments, validation, or other
initialization, you should probably switch to something like L<Moo>
instead.

=item C<< -destroy => I<coderef> >>

Allows you to specify a custom destructor. This coderef will be called from the
object's actual C<DESTROY> in void context with the first argument being the
same as the first argument to the C<DESTROY> method. Errors will be converted
to warnings.
This option was added in v0.14.

=item C<< -clean => I<bool> >>

Whether or not to clean up the generated package when the object is
destroyed. Defaults to I<false> when C<-class> is specified, I<true>
otherwise. If this is I<false>, be aware that the packages will stay
in Perl's symbol table and use memory accordingly.

=item C<< -lock => I<bool> >>

Whether or not to use L<Hash::Util>'s C<lock_ref_keys> to prevent
modifications to the hash's keyset. Defaults to I<true>.
The C<-nolock> option is provided as a short form of C<< -lock=>0 >>.

Keysets of objects created by the constructor generated by the
C<-new> option are also locked. Versions of this module before
v0.12 did not lock the keysets of new objects.

Note that on really old Perls, that is, before Perl v5.8.9,
L<Hash::Util> and its C<lock_ref_keys> are not available, so the hash
is never locked on those versions of Perl. Versions of this module
before v0.06 did not lock the keyset.
Versions of this module as of v0.12 issue a warning on old Perls.

=item C<-nolock>

Short form of the option C<< -lock=>0 >>.

=item C<-ro>

Makes the entire hash read-only using L<Hash::Util>'s C<lock_hashref> and the
generated accessors will also throw an error if you try to change values. In
other words, this makes the object and the underlying hash immutable.

You cannot specify any C<@additional_keys> with this option enabled unless you
also use the C<-new> option - the additional keys will then only be useful as
arguments to the constructor. This option can't be used with C<-nolock> or
C<< -lock=>0 >>.

This option was added in v0.12. Using this option will not work and cause a
warning when used on really old Perls (before v5.8.9), because this
functionality was not yet available there.

=item C<-force>

Supplying this option means that this function will also accept already blessed
hashrefs, which will then be re-C<bless>ed. However, you cannot re-bless
objects created by this module. *Note* that reblessing an object like this will
cause the original destructor(s) to not be called, which may not be what you
want! This option was added in v0.16.

=for comment
	the following is tested in xt/config_tiny.t

For example, you can convert a L<Config::Tiny> object via
C<< h2o -force, -recurse, -nolock, $config; >> so you can access configuration
options via methods. As of L<Config::Tiny> v2.27, you could even convert the
object back to a L<Config::Tiny> object, for example if you wanted to write it
back out, via C<< $config = Config::Tiny->new($config); >>. In both cases, the
object will not be copied, only reblessed, B<however>, for the second
conversion, be aware that the temporary package will not be deleted, so you may
want to do C<< $config = Config::Tiny->new({%$config}); >> instead. Note the
C<-nolock> in the first example is only needed for this second conversion.

=back

=head3 C<$hashref>

You must supply a plain (unblessed) hash reference here, unless you use the
L<C<-force>|/"-force"> option.

Be aware that this function I<does> modify the original hashref(s) by blessing
it and locking its keyset (the latter can be disabled with the
C<-lock> option), and if you use C<-meth> or C<-classify>, keys whose
values are code references will be removed.

An accessor will be set up for each key in the hash; note that the
keys must of course be valid Perl identifiers for you to be able to
call the method normally.

The following keys will be treated specially by this module. Please note that
there are further keys that are treated specially by Perl and/or that other
code may expect to be special, such as L<UNIVERSAL>'s C<isa>. See also
L<perlsub> and the references therein.

=over

=item C<new>

This key is not allowed in the hash if the C<-new> option is on.

=item C<DESTROY>

This key is not allowed except if all of the following apply:

=over

=item *

C<-destroy> is not used,

=item *

C<-clean> is off (which happens by default when you use C<-class>),

=item *

C<-meth> is on, and

=item *

the value of the key C<DESTROY> is a coderef.

=back

Versions of this module before v0.14 allowed a C<DESTROY> key in more
circumstances (whenever C<-clean> was off).

=item C<AUTOLOAD>

If your hash contains a key named C<AUTOLOAD>, or this key is present in
C<@additional_keys>, this module will set up a method called C<AUTOLOAD>, which
is subject to Perl's normal autoloading behavior - see L<perlsub/Autoloading>
and L<perlobj/AUTOLOAD>. Without the C<-meth> option, you will get a
"catch-all" accessor to which all method calls to unknown method names will go,
and with C<-meth> enabled (which is implied by C<-classify>), you can install
your own custom C<AUTOLOAD> handler by passing a coderef as the value for this
key. However, it is important to note that enabling autoloading removes any
typo protection on method names.

=back

=head3 C<@additional_keys>

Methods will be set up for these keys even if they do not exist in the hash.

Please see the list of keys that are treated specially above.

=head3 Returns

The (now blessed and optionally locked) C<$hashref>.

Inspired in part by C<lock_keys> from L<Hash::Util>.

Many, many other modules exist to simplify object creation in Perl.
This one is mine C<;-P>

Similar modules include L<Object::Adhoc|Object::Adhoc>,
L<Object::Anon|Object::Anon>, L<Hash::AsObject|Hash::AsObject>,
L<Object::Result|Object::Result>, and L<Hash::Wrap|Hash::Wrap>,
the latter of which also contains a comprehensive list of similar
modules.

For real OO work, I like L<Moo> and L<Type::Tiny>.
